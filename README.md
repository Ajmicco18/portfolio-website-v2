# Portfolio Website Version 2

This is the second version of my portfolio website. I developed it using Next.JS and TypeScript using ChakraUI's component library. 

To run my website locally, follow these steps: 

1. Install the required packages:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the localhost server:

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```
